# Minesweeper December 2023

## Project Description

#### Welcome to my Minesweeper project! This is a simple minesweeper game with max board 
#### size of dimensions 39 x 39. For each square of the board, binary operators are used to
#### determine whether the square at that position should be hidden, marked, or revealed.
#### When a mine is overturned, the game ends. The player wins when all non-mines have been
#### revealed. 

## Motivation/Credits

#### This project was inspired by a C++ assignment from my first-year programming course.
#### After coding such an assignment, I decided it would be good to take my code a step
#### further, while practicing a language I had learned previously. This way, I could
#### relearn the syntax while further familiarizing myself with the concepts introduced
#### in that course. 

## How to Play

#### Instructions will be printed out by the code. Note that all user inputs must be integers.
